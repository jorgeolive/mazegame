# mazegame

This is an WIP project about a CSS-based labyrinth multiplayer game, built over the MERN stack.

It plays with several math-ish concepts, such as:

- Randomized BFS graph generation algorythm, implemented at the backend.
- Optimized shortest path finding algorythms for the monsters.
There're some optimizations on the algorithm side, to convert array into maps to achieve O(1) perf. for the most part. 

On the tech side, obviously it's heavily based on socket.io library, which feels blazing fast.

At some point it would be cool to replace the whole css thing with p5.js, but, who has the time anyway? :)

Features to add eventually:

-some css to the menus *PLEASE!
-Score and game count down
-placing random items to be collected
-Collision detection
-Monsters
