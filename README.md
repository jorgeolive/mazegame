# mazegame

This is an WIP project about a CSS-based labyrinth multiplayer game, built over the MERN stack.

It plays with several concepts, such as:

- Randomized BFS graph generation algorythm, implemented at the backend.
- Optimized shortest path finding algorythms for the monsters.
- Collision detection
